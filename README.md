### 6. Customization

#### Customizing the Design:
1. **CSS**: You can modify the `style.css` file to change the colors, typography, layout, and overall look of the page.
2. **Images**: Replace the images in the `assets/images` folder with your own or link to external image sources.
3. **Fonts**: Modify the `font-family` in the CSS to use any font you like. You can link to Google Fonts or upload custom font files in the `assets/fonts` directory.

#### Modifying the Content:
1. **Hero Section**: Edit the heading and subheading within the `<section class="hero">` in `index.html`.
2. **Form**: Update the form fields and action URL to capture form submissions or link to an email service.
3. **Links**: Modify the navigation links to match the sections or external pages you want to point to.

#### Adding More Sections:
1. Copy the structure of the existing sections (like `.hero`, `.features`, `.cta`) and paste them where needed in `index.html`.
2. Update content and styling to match your new sections.
